# If
Until now, programs ran from beginning to end following a single logic path.\
But most of the time, we need different flows in our programs. Control flow
plays a big part in making that happen.

> The if statement determines whether one or more expressions would be executed. It makes this decision by evaluating a logical expression. It has the same meaning as the English word "if", as in the phrase "if there is coffee then I will drink coffee".
